**Supported business types:**  
Salons · Barbershops · Spas · Dental clinics · Fitness studios ·  
Auto repair shops · Cafes · Tattoo studios · Retail shops & kiosks

- Zero commission — 100% of revenue goes to you

### 👥 CRM & Clients

- CSV import from Fresha, Vagaro, Booksy, Mindbody, Square

### 🛒 POS & Checkout
- Fast checkout: services and products in one cart

### 🔔 Omnichannel Notifications (free, your own credentials)
- Email (Resend / SMTP)

- Viber Bot
- Auto-events: booking confirmation, 24h reminder, 1h reminder, thank-you, reactivation, birthday, low stock

### ⚙️ Modular System

Enable only what you need:

| Preset | Modules enabled |

| **Salon / Barbershop** | Bookings + CRM + POS + Inventory + Notifications |
| **Shop / Kiosk** | POS + Inventory + Notifications (no booking calendar) |
| **Cafe** | POS + CRM + Inventory + Notifications |

Toggle modules in **Settings → Modules** — unused tabs disappear from the sidebar.

### 📊 Analytics
- Dashboard shows today's revenue with a 7-day sparkline
- Full analytics dashboard (top services/products, client LTV, visit frequency) is cloud-only — see below

### 🌐 Multi-language
- Interface available in English, Spanish (LatAm), Italian, Portuguese (Brazil)

## Quick Start

### Self-hosted (Docker)

**Requirements:** Docker, Docker Compose, a free [Supabase](https://supabase.com) account.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/SGrappelli/BookingPro.git
cd BookingPro

# 2. Copy environment file and fill in your values
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Disable email confirmation in Supabase (required for self-hosted)
#    Dashboard → Authentication → Providers → Email → uncheck "Confirm email" → Save

# 4. Start — migrations run automatically on first start
docker-compose up -d
```

Open http://localhost:3000

### Supabase Setup

1. Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Copy your **Database connection string** (Session mode, port 5432) from  
   **Project Settings → Database → Connection string** and set it as `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`  
   Migrations are applied automatically when you run `docker-compose up`
3. Create a public storage bucket named **`inventory`** in  
   **Supabase Dashboard → Storage → New bucket** (required for product photos)
4. Copy your project URL and anon/service keys to `.env`
5. **Customize email templates** (optional) — replace Supabase's defaults with BookingPro-branded HTML:

   | Template in Supabase | File |
   |---|---|
   | Reset Password | `supabase/email-templates/reset-password.html` |
   | Confirm signup | `supabase/email-templates/confirm-signup.html` |
   | Change Email Address | `supabase/email-templates/email-change.html` |

### Cloud (no setup required)

Start free at [trypronto.app](https://trypronto.app) — no credit card, no commission.

A few features are cloud-only and not part of the self-hosted core:
- Loyalty points program
- Analytics dashboard

## Security checklist after installation

After deploying, log into your Supabase project dashboard and check **Advisors → Security Advisor**. This project follows Postgres/Supabase RLS best practices in every migration, but Supabase's own advisor is the only way to confirm the live state of your specific database — including any objects that may have existed in your project before running these migrations, or custom changes you've made yourself. Fix anything flagged there before using this in production with real customer data.

---

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in:

```env
# Supabase (required)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key

# PostgreSQL connection string (for automatic migrations)
# Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → Database → Connection string (Session mode)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.[ref]:[password]@[host]:5432/postgres

# App
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Email notifications (choose one)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxx
# or SMTP_HOST / SMTP_PORT / SMTP_USER / SMTP_PASS / SMTP_FROM

# Cron (protects /api/cron/notify)
CRON_SECRET=replace-with-random-string
```

Messenger credentials (Telegram, WhatsApp, Viber) are configured per-business in  
**Settings → Notifications** — not in environment variables.

## Notifications

### Notification Events

| Trigger | Who receives it | Channel |
|---|---|---|
| Booking confirmed | Client | Email + WhatsApp |
| Booking confirmed | Business owner | Telegram + Viber |
| 24h before appointment | Client | Email + WhatsApp + Telegram† + Viber† |
| 24h before appointment | Business owner | Telegram + Viber |
| 1h before appointment | Client | Email + WhatsApp + Telegram† + Viber† |
| 1h before appointment | Business owner | Telegram + Viber |
| After visit completed | Client (thank-you + rebook link) | Email + WhatsApp + Telegram† + Viber† |
| 30 days no visit | Client (re-activation) | Email + WhatsApp |
| Birthday | Client | Email + WhatsApp |
| Low stock alert | Business owner | Email + Telegram + Viber |

† Client receives Telegram/Viber notifications only if they have linked their profile via `/link {phone}` in the bot.

### Cron Setup

Call this endpoint every 15 minutes from [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org) (free):

```
GET https://yourdomain.com/api/cron/notify
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET
```

Or use the built-in pg_cron scheduler — edit `supabase/migrations/007_cron_jobs.sql` (replace `YOUR_APP_URL` and `YOUR_CRON_SECRET`), enable **pg_cron** and **pg_net** extensions in Supabase Dashboard, then run the file via SQL Editor.

### Telegram Bot

1. Open [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) → `/newbot` → copy the token
2. In BookingPro: **Settings → Notifications** → paste token → click **Connect**
3. Open your bot in Telegram → send `/start`

Owner commands: `/today` — today's appointments · `/help` — command list

Clients link their profile by sending `/link +12345678900` to the bot (their booking phone number).

### Viber Bot

> ⚠️ Since February 2024, new Viber bots require a commercial agreement (~€100/month). This integration works for bots created before February 2024. **For new setups, Telegram is recommended (free).**

1. Sign in to [partners.viber.com](https://partners.viber.com) → copy auth token
2. In BookingPro: **Settings → Notifications** → paste token → click **Connect**

Clients link via `/link +12345678900` in the bot.

### WhatsApp (Meta Cloud API)

1. [developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com) → create a Meta App → add **WhatsApp** product
2. Copy *Phone Number ID* and *Access Token* from **WhatsApp → API Setup**
3. **Recommended:** create a permanent token via Meta Business Manager → System Users → Generate Token with `whatsapp_business_messaging` + `whatsapp_business_management` permissions
4. Paste credentials in **Settings → Notifications → WhatsApp** and save

> ⚠️ Business-initiated messages (reminders, thank-you, birthday) require **pre-approved Message Templates** submitted through Meta Business Manager. Without them, these messages are silently dropped by Meta. Create templates at [business.facebook.com → Account tools → Message templates](https://business.facebook.com).

---

## Deployment

### VPS / Server

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SGrappelli/BookingPro.git
cd BookingPro
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env
docker-compose up -d
```

Point your domain to the server and set up a reverse proxy (Nginx, Caddy, or Cloudflare Tunnel).

### Nginx example

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

## Adding a New Language

1. Copy `messages/en.json` to `messages/fr.json` (or any locale code)
